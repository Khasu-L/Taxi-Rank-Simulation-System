# Taxi-Rank-Simulation-System

Designed and implemented a simulation of a real world taxi rank to manage passenger arrivals, queueing and boarding by destination.

Used arrays and structs to simulate queue and and stack behavior for each route.

Handled time based input/output, allowing dynamic boarding and waiting logic.

Displayed ech simulation time step in a tabular format showing passenger flows and taxi capacities.

Focused on object-oriented design and clean terminal interface using C++.
